## About me

I am a positive-thinking and open minded person. I am organised, structured and attentive to detail. I also love to communicate with people and solve problems. 

I got my Bachelor's Degree in CSE from Fareast International University in October, 2021.

Now, I wish to exploit my knowledge and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
